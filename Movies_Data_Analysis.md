### Limitations:

**1**:In the 3rd question i was only able to get 14 genres which I thought was major ones.Was not able to get all the information

**2**:No information regarding how popularity is calculated was given.So I had no idea how important it is or it is not.

**3**:Categorizing rating as High low and Moderate was merely under my observation.This may defer for someone else
